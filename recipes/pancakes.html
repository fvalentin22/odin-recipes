        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for 
        busy mornings or breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these
        baked pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan 
        pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding your favorite 
        fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>3 cups baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 
                a sheet pan (approx. 13 x18 inches) or jelly roll pan 
                (12x17 inches) with parchment paper. Spray the parchment 
                paper with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla 
                extract, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Mix until 
                the ingredients are well combined, but don't overmix. 
                Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 
                18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper 
                with the pancake from the pan and set it onto a cutting 
                board. Slice the pancake sheet into squares using a pizza 
                cutter or into your desired shapes with a cookie cutter.</li>
        </ol>
